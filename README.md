                <ul class="ismList">
                    
                        <li>2 Goalkeepers</li>

            <h2 id="ismRulesMyTeam">Managing Your Team</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Choosing Your Starting 11</h3>

                <p>From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek <a href="#_ismRulesDeadlines">deadline</a> to form your team.</p>

                <p>All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.

                <p>Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.

                <h3>Selecting a Captain and a Vice-Captain</h3>

                <p>From your starting 11 you nominate a captain and a vice-captain. Your captain's score will be doubled.</p>

                <p>If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, the captain will be changed to the vice-captain.</p>

                <p>If both captain and vice-captain play 0 minutes in a Gameweek, then no player's score will be doubled.</p>

                <h3>Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions</h3>

                <p>Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who don't play in a Gameweek.</p>

                <p>Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:</p>

                <ul class="ismList">
                    <li>If your Goalkeeper plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, he will be substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the Gameweek.</li>
                    <li>If any of your outfield players play 0 minutes in the Gameweek, they will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute who played in the Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only be replaced by another defender).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- TRANSFERS -->
            <h2>Making Transfers</h2>
            <div>
                <p>After selecting your squad you can buy and sell players in the transfer market. Unlimited transfers can be made at no cost until your first deadline.</p>

                <p>After your first deadline you will receive 1 free transfer each Gameweek. Each additional transfer you make in the same Gameweek will deduct 4 points from your total score (Classic scoring) and match score (Head-to-Head scoring) at the start of the next Gameweek. </p>

                <p>If you do not use your free transfer, you are able to make an additional free transfer the following Gameweek. If you do not use this saved free transfer in the following Gameweek, it will be carried over until you do. You can never have more than 1 saved transfer.</p>

                <h3>Wildcards</h3>
                <p>A Wildcard allows you to make unlimited free transfers throughout a Gameweek. You can use up to 2 a season.</p>

                <p>Playing a wildcard will remove any points deductions from transfers already made in the same Gameweek.</p>

                <p>One wildcard can be played at any time. The January Wildcard can only be used after Gameweek 20 starts (1 Jan 11:30) until Gameweek 23 ends (1 Feb 11:30); as the January wildcard isn't available until after the Gameweek 20 deadline, the earliest these transfers will be active is Gameweek 21.</p>

                <p>When playing a Wildcard, any saved free transfers will be lost. You will be back to the usual 1 free transfer the following Gameweek.

                <h3>Player Prices</h3>

                <p>Player prices change during the season dependent on the popularity of the player in the transfer market. Player prices do not change until the season starts.</p>

                <p>The price shown on your transfers page is a player's selling price. This selling price may be less than the player's current purchase price as a sell-on fee of 50% (rounded up to the nearest £0.1m) will be applied on any profits made on that player.</p>

                <p>For example, if you buy a player for £8.3m and when you transfer him his price is £9.0m, his selling price will be £8.6m.</p>

                <h3>Clean sheets</h3>

                <p>A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes.</p>

                <p>If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not affect any clean sheet bonus.</p>

                <h3>Red Cards</h3>

                <p>If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised for goals conceded by their team.</p>

                <p>Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards</p>

                <h3>Assists</h3>

                <p>Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who makes the final pass before a goal is scored. An assist is awarded whether the pass was intentional (that it actually creates the chance) or unintentional (that the player had to dribble the ball or an inadvertent touch or shot created the chance).</p>
                <p>If an opposing player touches the ball after the final pass before a goal is scored, significantly altering the intended destination of the ball, then no assist is awarded.</p>
                <p><strong>Rebounds</strong><br />If a shot on goal is blocked by an opposition player, is saved by a goalkeeper or hits the woodwork, and a goal is scored from the rebound, then an assist is awarded.</p>
                <p><strong>Own Goals</strong><br />If a player shoots or passes the ball and forces an opposing player to put the ball in his own net, then an assist is awarded.</p>
                <p><strong>Penalties and Free-Kicks</strong><br />In the event of a penalty or free-kick, the player earning the penalty or free-kick is awarded an assist if a goal is directly scored, but not if he takes it himself, in which case no assist is given.</p>
                <p><strong>Finalising Assists</strong><br />Assist points awarded by Opta within Fantasy Premier League are calculated using additional stats which may differ from other websites. For example, some other sites would not show an assist where a player has won a penalty.</p>
                <p>For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to change up until one hour after the final whistle of the last match of any given day. Once the points have all been updated on that day, no further adjustments to points will be made.</p>

                <h3>Bonus Points</h3>

                <p>A new Bonus Points System (BPS) has been created which utilises a range of statistics to create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing players in each match will be awarded bonus points. 3 points will be awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to the third. </p>

                <p>Examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="ismList">
                    <li>If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.</li>
                    <li>If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.</li>
                    <li>If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 & 4 will receive 1 point each.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How is the BPS score calculated?</h3>

                <p>Players score BPS points based on the following statistics (one point for each unless otherwise stated):</p>

            <h2>Leagues</h2>
            <div>
                <p>After entering your squad, you can join and create leagues to compete with friends and other game players.</p>
                <h3>League Types</h3>
                <h4>Private Leagues</h4>
                <p>Private leagues are the heart and soul of the game, where you compete against your friends. Just create a league and then send out the unique code to allow your friends to join, easy! </p>
                <p>You can compete in up to 15 private leagues. There's no limit on the number of teams in a single league.</p>
                <h4>Public Leagues</h4>
                <p>Need an extra challenge? Then join a public league of 20 randomly assigned teams. You can compete in up to 3 public leagues.</p>

                <h4>Global Leagues</h4>
                <p>You are automatically entered into the following global leagues:</p>
                <ul class="ismList">
                    <li>The overall league featuring all registered teams</li>
                    <li>A league for fellow managers from your country</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>League Scoring</h3>
                <p>All leagues score on either a Classic or Head-to-Head basis.</p>
                <h4>Classic Scoring</h4>
                <p>In a league with classic scoring, teams are ranked based on their total points in the game. You can join or leave a league with classic scoring at any point during the season.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has made the least amount of transfers will be positioned higher.</p>
                <p>Classic scoring leagues are run over a number of phases:</p>

                <p>Any transfer point deductions in the Gameweek before a phase starts won't be deducted from the phase score. For example, any transfers made in Gameweek 3 (preparing for Gameweek 4) won't be deducted from your September score.</p>
                <h4>Head-to-Head Scoring</h4>
                <p>In a league with head-to-head scoring, every team plays a match against another team in the league each Gameweek. The match result is based on the Gameweek score of each team minus any transfer points spent preparing for the Gameweek.</p>
                <p>3 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw, teams are then ranked on points earned in Head-to-Head matches.</p>
                <p>Head-to-Head fixtures are generated at the start of the league's first Gameweek. Once these fixtures have been generated the league is locked and teams will not be able to join or leave.</p>
                <p>If a Head-to-Head league has an odd number of teams then an average team will join the league to ensure each team has a fixture every Gameweek. This team will always score the Gameweek average.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has most game points will be positioned higher.</p>
                <h4>Head-to-Head Knock-out stage</h4>
                <p>Optionally, a Head-to-Head league may end with a knock-out stage over up to 3 Gameweeks with the league winner decided by a match in the final Gameweek. The automatically entered average team will not enter the knock-out stage, their place being taken by the next placed team.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie between teams in a Head-to-Head knock-out match, the following tie-breaks will be used:</p>
                <ol class="ismList ismNumList">
                    <li>Most goals scored in the Gameweek</li>
                    <li>Fewest goals conceded in the Gameweek</li>
                    <li>Virtual coin toss</li>

                <h2>The Cup</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>The first round of the cup will be Gameweek 18.</p>
                    <h3>Qualifying</h3>
                    
                        <p>The top 2,097,152 scorers in Gameweek 17 will enter the first round. If there are more than 2,097,152 qualifiers then there will be a random draw amongst the lowest scorers to see who qualifies.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>Each qualifying team will be randomly drawn against another in the first round. The winner (the team with the highest gameweek score minus any transfer points), will progress to the second round and another random draw, the losers are out! This process continues until the final Gameweek when the two remaining teams contest the cup final.</p>
                    <p>If a cup match is drawn, then the following tie-breaks will be applied until a winner is found:</p>
                    <ol class="ismList ismNumList">
                        <li>Most goals scored in the Gameweek</li>
                        <li>Fewest goals conceded in the Gameweek</li>

    9. Any personal information which you submit will be controlled in accordance with The Premier League's privacy policy and all UK legislation governing the same. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not disclose your personal information to any other Player unless a) this is restricted to those details in terms 24-25, or b) if we are required to do so by a competent authority or court within the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    10. Both UK and non-UK residents entering the Game are subject to their teams being automatically entered into a “Country League”. A Country League is simply a mini-league named after the country entered by the Player when registering a team. In association with the official Premier League Broadcaster in selected territories, the Premier League may choose to offer a prize to the overall winner of such Country Leagues. The nature of the prize and the countries selected for this purpose are at the sole discretion of the Premier League. There is no opt-out from a Country League but participation in no way obligates the Player to receive marketing communications from the Premier League or Broadcaster unless otherwise indicated during Registration.
</p>
<p>
    11. The Premier League doesn’t condone users setting up/joining leagues charging for entry and cannot be held responsible for their management or any loss suffered through users’ involvement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Game Rules</strong>
</p>
<p>
    12. The Game will be governed by the Game Rules from time to time published on the Site by The Premier League ("Game Rules"). The Premier League reserves the right to alter, amend or supplement the Game Rules from time to time in its absolute discretion in the event of any circumstances beyond its reasonable control arising or where it considers it desirable to do so. You agree that no liability shall attach to The Premier League as a result of any such change and so are advised to check the Game Rules regularly from time to time. The Game Rules form part of these terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
    13. The Premier League will be the sole decision-maker of any matter of interpretation of the Game Rules and any aspect of the content of, or playing of, the Game. The Premier League will not enter into correspondence relating to such matters and its decision as to any matter arising out of or in connection with the Game Rules including but not limited to the allocation of points to any Player and/or the award of any Prize and/or any ranking or league table shall be final and conclusive.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Prizes and Winner's Details</strong>
</p>
<p>
    14. The prizes awarded in respect of the Game ("Prizes") will be at the discretion of The Premier League from time to time and The Premier League reserves the right to alter and amend the Prizes where circumstances beyond its reasonable control require it to do so.

Winners will be notified of their success by email in respect of the Monthly Prizes by the 28th day of the month following the month in respect of which such Prize is awarded and in respect of the Winner's Prize by Friday 19th June 2015 at which time they must confirm their contact details prior to the Prize in question being delivered.
</p>
<p>
    24. The winners' names will be published on the Site by the 28th day of the month following the month in respect of which the Monthly Prize is awarded in respect of winners of Monthly Prizes and by Friday 19th June 2015 in respect of the winner of the Winner's Prize; or alternatively winner's names can be obtained by sending a stamped self-addressed envelope to Fantasy Premier League, The Premier League, 30 Gloucester Place, London W1U 8PL.
</p>
<p>
    25. Subject always to term 39 below, Players' names and addresses and the winners' photographic images and their comments relating to any Prize may be used without limitation for future promotional, marketing and publicity purposes of The Premier League in any and all media worldwide without notice to them and without any fee being paid.
</p>
<p>
    26. If you are under 18, then the above Prizes information will apply differently to you should you win a Prize. Please see terms 35-40 below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Message Boards</strong>
</p>
<p>
    27. Through the Game, The Premier League is seeking to facilitate a self-moderated discussion group and message board facility for football fans. The Premier League does not pre-screen any content posted or disseminated through the message boards.
</p>
<p>
    28. Because the message boards are self-moderated, you should understand that when using the Game, you might come across some content which you find offensive or objectionable. If you do come across such content then you are free to register a complaint in relation to this. You should note that the views expressed on message boards are the views of the individual concerned, which may be different to those of the Premier League.
</p>
<p>
    29. If you post any message on a message board then you are confirming that:
</p>
<p>
    1. the message includes nothing which would be a breach of these terms;
</p>
<p>
    2. the message is non-confidential and non-proprietary and that the Premier League may make use of that message in any way it sees fit and without acknowledgement; and
</p>
<p>
    3. users of the message board may access the message on terms similar to these.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to restrict the use of any message, then you are advised not to submit it.
</p>
<p>
    30. You are entirely responsible for any messages which you post. You shall be entirely responsible for any losses that The Premier League, or any other users may suffer as a result of any messages you post, or otherwise as a result of your use of the Game.
</p>
<p>
    31. Generally, you must ensure that you only use the message boards in order to post messages which are (in the reasonable opinion of The Premier League) legal, decent, proper and relevant.
</p>
<p>
    32. By way of example, and without limiting your obligation under term 30, you must ensure that you:
</p>
<p>
    1. comply with any instructions from Fantasy Premier League;
</p>
<p>
    2. do not defame, threaten, harass, abuse, or otherwise violate the rights of others (whether they are users of Fantasy Premier League or not);
</p>
<p>
    3. do not post messages which are unlawful, defamatory, obscene, objectionable, or inappropriate;
</p>
<p>
    4. do not bring The Premier League, any member Club of The Premier League, or the game of football into disrepute;
</p>
<p>
    5. do not promote or provide unlawful instructions to others;
</p>
<p>
    6. do not post any messages which could interfere with the intellectual property rights or confidential information of others;
</p>
<p>
    7. do not post messages containing commercial messages or advertising;
</p>
<p>
    8. do not impersonate anyone else;
</p>
<p>
    9. do not use the message boards to harvest personal information about others;
</p>
<p>
    10. do not contain personal information of others in any messages, unless that use is lawful, or you have their consent; and
</p>
<p>
    11. do not transmit any viruses or other harmful code.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that The Premier League will seek to use these terms to prohibit all such behaviour. However, The Premier League cannot guarantee that you will not be exposed to such behaviour. If you should encounter it, please feel free to make a complaint accordingly by emailing <a href="mailto:support@mail.fantasy.premierleague.com">support@mail.fantasy.premierleague.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    33. The Premier League advises that you exercise caution in revealing any personal information about yourself on any message boards.
</p>
<p>
    34. The Premier League reserves the right at any time and for any reason to:
</p>
<p>
    1. temporarily or permanently suspend your access to the message boards;
</p>
<p>
    2. delete any of your messages;
</p>
<p>
    3. require any of your future messages to be pre-vetted;
</p>
<p>
    4. take any other action against your account as it sees fit.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Applicants Under 18 Years of Age</strong>
</p>
<p>
    35. If you are under 18 years of age, then you are welcome to enter the Game, but you should carefully read these terms, and ensure that your parent or responsible guardian also does so, before submitting your application.
</p>
<p>
    36. You will be eligible to win the Monthly Prizes provided:
</p>
<p>
    1. that they do not contain cash, and they will in no circumstances be substituted for cash; and
</p>
<p>
    2. we receive a note of written consent from your parent or guardian confirming that they were happy for you to play the Game and to receive the Prize.
</p>
<p>
    37. You will only be eligible for the Winner's Prize if we receive a note of written consent from your parent or guardian confirming that:
</p>
<p>
    1. they were happy for you to play the Game;
</p>
<p>
    2. that they are happy for you to receive the winner’s Prize; and
</p>
<p>
    3. they will accompany you at all times on the trip.
</p>
<p>
    38. If we receive the requisite consent to our reasonable satisfaction all tickets and accommodation will be booked in the name of your parent or guardian accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    39. If you do win a Prize, and if The Premier League wishes to use any comments, details, or photographs of you, then they will always seek the express written consent of your parent or guardian before doing so.
</p>
<p>
    40. If when using the message boards you feel at any time harassed, distressed, or bullied by any of the messages, please immediately email <a href="mailto:support@mail.fantasy.premierleague.com">support@mail.fantasy.premierleague.com</a> and also inform your parent or guardian.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Responsibility and Remedies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    41. The extent of The Premier League's responsibility to you has been determined in the context of the following:
</p>
<p>
    1. the Game is provided to you free of charge;
</p>
<p>
    2. message boards are not checked or verified by the Premier League;
</p>
<p>
    3. you are responsible for any action you do or do not take as a result of the Game and the information therein;
</p>
<p>
    4. you are responsible for ensuring that your equipment is enabled with appropriate up-to-date virus checking software.
</p>
<p>
    42. While The Premier League will endeavour to ensure that the Game is available to you at all times and that the contents are correct and accurate, it cannot make any legal commitment to you that this will be the case. However, The Premier League will exercise reasonable skill and care in providing any service to you.
</p>
<p>
    43. The Premier League cannot accept any liability to you for any of the following types of loss which you may suffer as a result of your entry to the Game:
</p>
<p>
    1. loss which was not foreseeable to you and The Premier League when you first applied for the Game (even if that loss results from The Premier League's failure to comply with these terms or its negligence);
</p>
<p>
    2. any business loss you may suffer, including loss of revenue, profits, or anticipated savings (whether those losses are the direct or indirect result of the Premier League's default);
</p>
<p>
    3. loss which you suffer other than as a result of our failure to comply with these terms or our negligence or breach of statutory duty;
</p>
<p>
    4. any loss which you may suffer as a result of or in connection with or arising out of any Prize.
</p>
<p>
    44. Nothing in these terms will limit The Premier League's liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence or if they deliberately lied to you before you entered.
</p>
<p>
    45. Any breach by you of the Game Rules from time to time shall also be a breach of these terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
    46. In the event of any breach by you of these terms and conditions The Premier League reserves the right to:
</p>
<p>
    1. take any action described in term 34 above;
</p>
<p>
    2. refuse entry to the Game;
</p>
<p>
    3. disqualify you from the Game;
</p>
<p>
    4. require any reasonable amendment to your application or entry.
</p>
<p>
    If you are barred or disqualified from entry, you shall not be eligible to participate in the Game under any other identity or team name. Any such decision by The Premier League shall be final.
</p>
<p>
    47. If any of these terms are determined to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise enforceable then the remaining terms shall continue in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    48. These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.
