    <strong><a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/">Selecting Your Initial Squad</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Squad Size</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To join the game select a fantasy football squad of 15 players, consisting of:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        2 Goalkeepers
    </li>
    <li>
        5 Defenders
    </li>
    <li>
        5 Midfielders
    </li>
    <li>
        3 Forwards
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Budget</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The total value of your initial squad must not exceed £100 million.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Players per team</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can select up to 3 players from a single Barclays Premier League team.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/">Managing Your Team</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Choosing Your Starting 11</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/#_ismRulesDeadlines">deadline</a> to form your
    team.
</p>
<p>
    All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.
</p>
<p>
    Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Selecting a Captain and a Vice-Captain</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From your starting 11 you nominate a captain and a vice-captain. Your captain's score will be doubled.
</p>
<p>
    If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, the captain will be changed to the vice-captain.
</p>
<p>
    If both captain and vice-captain play 0 minutes in a Gameweek, then no player's score will be doubled.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who don't play in a
    Gameweek.
</p>
<p>
    Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        If your Goalkeeper plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, he will be substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the Gameweek.
    </li>
    <li>
        If any of your outfield players play 0 minutes in the Gameweek, they will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute who played in the
        Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only be replaced by another defender).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/">Making Transfers</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
    After selecting your squad you can buy and sell players in the transfer market. Unlimited transfers can be made at no cost until your first deadline.
</p>
<p>
    After your first deadline you will receive 1 free transfer each Gameweek. Each additional transfer you make in the same Gameweek will deduct 4 points from
    your total score (Classic scoring) and match score (Head-to-Head scoring) at the start of the next Gameweek.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not use your free transfer, you are able to make an additional free transfer the following Gameweek. If you do not use this saved free transfer
    in the following Gameweek, it will be carried over until you do. You can never have more than 1 saved transfer.
</p>
<h3>
    Wildcards
</h3>
<p>
    A Wildcard allows you to make unlimited free transfers throughout a Gameweek. You can use up to 2 a season.
</p>
<p>
    Playing a wildcard will remove any points deductions from transfers already made in the same Gameweek.
</p>
<p>
    One wildcard can be played at any time. The January Wildcard can only be used after Gameweek 20 starts (1 Jan 11:30) until Gameweek 23 ends (1 Feb 11:30);
    as the January wildcard isn't available until after the Gameweek 20 deadline, the earliest these transfers will be active is Gameweek 21.
</p>
<p>
    When playing a Wildcard, any saved free transfers will be lost. You will be back to the usual 1 free transfer the following Gameweek.
</p>
<h3>
    Player Prices
</h3>
<p>
    Player prices change during the season dependent on the popularity of the player in the transfer market. Player prices do not change until the season
    starts.
</p>
<p>
    The price shown on your transfers page is a player's selling price. This selling price may be less than the player's current purchase price as a sell-on
    fee of 50% (rounded up to the nearest £0.1m) will be applied on any profits made on that player.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you buy a player for £8.3m and when you transfer him his price is £9.0m, his selling price will be £8.6m.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/">Deadlines</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
    All changes to your team (starting 11, transfers, captain changes, substitiution priorities) must be made by the Gameweek deadline in order to take effect
    for that set of matches.

<p>
    <strong>Clean sheets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not affect any clean sheet bonus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Red Cards</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised for goals conceded by their team.
</p>
<p>
    Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assists</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who makes the final pass before a goal is scored. An assist is awarded whether the pass was
    intentional (that it actually creates the chance) or unintentional (that the player had to dribble the ball or an inadvertent touch or shot created the
    chance).
</p>
<p>
    If an opposing player touches the ball after the final pass before a goal is scored, significantly altering the intended destination of the ball, then no
    assist is awarded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rebounds</strong>
    <br/>
    If a shot on goal is blocked by an opposition player, is saved by a goalkeeper or hits the woodwork, and a goal is scored from the rebound, then an assist
    is awarded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Own Goals</strong>
    <br/>
    If a player shoots or passes the ball and forces an opposing player to put the ball in his own net, then an assist is awarded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Penalties and Free-Kicks</strong>
    <br/>
    In the event of a penalty or free-kick, the player earning the penalty or free-kick is awarded an assist if a goal is directly scored, but not if he takes
    it himself, in which case no assist is given.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Finalising Assists</strong>
    <br/>
    Assist points awarded by Opta within Fantasy Premier League are calculated using additional stats which may differ from other websites. For example, some
    other sites would not show an assist where a player has won a penalty.
</p>
<p>
    For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to change up until one hour after the final whistle of the last match of any given day. Once
    the points have all been updated on that day, no further adjustments to points will be made.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bonus Points</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A new Bonus Points System (BPS) has been created which utilises a range of statistics to create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing
    players in each match will be awarded bonus points. 3 points will be awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to the third.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 &amp; 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 &amp; 4 will receive 1 point each.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>How is the BPS score calculated?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Players score BPS points based on the following statistics (one point for each unless otherwise stated):

</p>
<p>
    After entering your squad, you can join and create leagues to compete with friends and other game players.
</p>
<h3>
    League Types
</h3>
<h4>
    Private Leagues
</h4>
<p>
    Private leagues are the heart and soul of the game, where you compete against your friends. Just create a league and then send out the unique code to allow
    your friends to join, easy!
</p>
<p>
    You can compete in up to 15 private leagues. There's no limit on the number of teams in a single league.
</p>
<h4>
    Public Leagues
</h4>
<p>
    Need an extra challenge? Then join a public league of 20 randomly assigned teams. You can compete in up to 3 public leagues.
</p>
<h4>
    Global Leagues
</h4>
<p>
    You are automatically entered into the following global leagues:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        The overall league featuring all registered teams
    </li>
    <li>
        A league for fellow managers from your country
    </li>
    <li>
        A league for supporters of your favourite Barclays Premier League team
    </li>
    <li>
        A league for managers starting the same Gameweek as you
    </li>
    <li>
        The Fantasy Cup (starts in Gameweek 18)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    League Scoring
</h3>
<p>
    All leagues score on either a Classic or Head-to-Head basis.
</p>
<h4>
    Classic Scoring
</h4>
<p>
    In a league with classic scoring, teams are ranked based on their total points in the game. You can join or leave a league with classic scoring at any
    point during the season.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has made the least amount of transfers will be positioned higher.
</p>
<p>
    Classic scoring leagues are run over a number of phases:

<p>
    Any transfer point deductions in the Gameweek before a phase starts won't be deducted from the phase score. For example, any transfers made in Gameweek 3
    (preparing for Gameweek 4) won't be deducted from your September score.
</p>
<h4>
    Head-to-Head Scoring
</h4>
<p>
    In a league with head-to-head scoring, every team plays a match against another team in the league each Gameweek. The match result is based on the Gameweek
    score of each team minus any transfer points spent preparing for the Gameweek.
</p>
<p>
    3 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw, teams are then ranked on points earned in Head-to-Head matches.
</p>
<p>
    Head-to-Head fixtures are generated at the start of the league's first Gameweek. Once these fixtures have been generated the league is locked and teams
    will not be able to join or leave.
</p>
<p>
    If a Head-to-Head league has an odd number of teams then an average team will join the league to ensure each team has a fixture every Gameweek. This team
    will always score the Gameweek average.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has most game points will be positioned higher.
</p>
<h4>
    Head-to-Head Knock-out stage
</h4>
<p>
    Optionally, a Head-to-Head league may end with a knock-out stage over up to 3 Gameweeks with the league winner decided by a match in the final Gameweek.
    The automatically entered average team will not enter the knock-out stage, their place being taken by the next placed team.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a tie between teams in a Head-to-Head knock-out match, the following tie-breaks will be used:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Most goals scored in the Gameweek
    </li>
    <li>
        Fewest goals conceded in the Gameweek
    </li>
    <li>
        Virtual coin toss
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong><a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/rules/">The Cup</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first round of the cup will be Gameweek 18.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Qualifying</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The top 2,097,152 scorers in Gameweek 17 will enter the first round. If there are more than 2,097,152 qualifiers then there will be a random draw amongst
    the lowest scorers to see who qualifies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How it works</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each qualifying team will be randomly drawn against another in the first round. The winner (the team with the highest gameweek score minus any transfer
    points), will progress to the second round and another random draw, the losers are out! This process continues until the final Gameweek when the two
    remaining teams contest the cup final.
</p>
<p>
    If a cup match is drawn, then the following tie-breaks will be applied until a winner is found:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Most goals scored in the Gameweek
    </li>
    <li>
        Fewest goals conceded in the Gameweek
    </li>
    <li>
        Virtual coin toss
    </li>
</ol>
